        Used to make sure the webhook request is authentic and comes from
        net2phone. To validate the signature:

        1. Retrieve the raw body of the webhook request.

        2. Concatentate two parts using the `:` character. The resulting string
        should looke like `{signature}:{raw_body}`.

        3. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash from the given string. Use the
        `x-net2phone-timestamp` header as the key. All "string to bytes"
        conversions should be performed using UTF-8 encoding.

        4. Convert the resulting HMAC-SHA256 hash bytes back to a string using
        HEX encoding (without `-` characters).

        5. Compare the resulting string with the value present in the
        `x-net2phone-signature` header. If they are equal, the request is
        authentic.


        See [support
        article](https://support.net2phone.com/s/article/Securing-net2phone-webhook-requests-to-your-application)
