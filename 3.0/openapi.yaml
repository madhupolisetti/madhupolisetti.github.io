        Groups call detail records by date (based on `start_time` and the
        timezone in user's profile) and unique combinations

        of the phone numbers (`from` and `to` fields).

        For each group only the latest call is returned.


        The list is sorted from most recent activities to the older ones.

        Note that the operation will return duplicate items when paginating over
        if new calls are made. The sorting order is

        not stable: items may be deleted and inserted into any position.


        The same access control rules are applied as for
        `SearchCallDetailRecords` operation. The additional filtering before
        grouping

        is possible with the `call_detail_record_filter` parameter. See the
        examples for the call detail record search to

        learn the filtering syntax.


        Optionally, metrics (e.g. call count) for each group can be requested.

        Used to make sure the webhook request is authentic and comes from
        net2phone. To validate the signature:

        1. Retrieve the raw body of the webhook request.

        2. Concatenate two parts using the `:` character. The resulting string
        should look like `{signature}:{raw_body}`.

        3. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash from the given string. Use the
        `x-net2phone-timestamp` header as the key. All "string to bytes"
        conversions should be performed using UTF-8 encoding.

        4. Convert the resulting HMAC-SHA256 hash bytes back to a string using
        HEX encoding (without `-` characters).

        5. Compare the resulting string with the value present in the
        `x-net2phone-signature` header. If they are equal, the request is
        authentic.

        A text query to filter out the paginated list of contacts.

        The case-insensitive search is performed using `extension`,
        `phone_numbers` and other fields specific to the contact 'type'.

        For example, for users `first_name`, `last_name` and `email` are
        searched.

        For departments, the `display_name` will be included in search.

        Non-alphanumeric characters are ignored.

        Whitespace characters between digits are ignored to ensure formatted
        phone numbers can be passed.


        For example:

        * `(213) 373-4253` is equivalent to `2133734253`.

        * `John   Doe` is equivalent to `john doe` and will search for
        case-insensitive inclusion of `john` or `doe` in contact fields.

        * `john +1 (23) 7534432 doe` will search for `john` or `1237534432` or
        `doe`.

        * `John75` will match a user with email `john75@example.org`.
