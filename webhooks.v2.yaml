    <h2>Introduction</h2>The net2phone webhooks give you the ability to receive
    a structured payload of data at the URL of your choice when certain events
    occur. For example, you can use the webhooks to notify your CRM application
    that a call has been completed or notify your messaging application that a
    call has been parked or unparked<br /><br /><h2>Getting started</h2>Log into
    https://app.net2phone.com and go to Settings / API, click on the ‘Webhook’
    tab, and click on ‘Add Webhook’, follow the on screen directions to set up
    the webhook.

        Used to make sure the webhook request is authentic and comes from
        net2phone. To validate the signature:

        1. Retrieve the raw body of the webhook request.

        2. Concatentate two parts using the `:` character. The resulting string
        should looke like `{signature}:{raw_body}`.

        3. Compute the HMAC-SHA256 hash from the given string. Use the
        `x-net2phone-timestamp` header as the key. All "string to bytes"
        conversions should be performed using UTF-8 encoding.

        4. Convert the resulting HMAC-SHA256 hash bytes back to a string using
        HEX encoding (without `-` characters).

        5. Compare the resulting string with the value present in the
        `x-net2phone-signature` header. If they are equal, the request is
        authentic.
